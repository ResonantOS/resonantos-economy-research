## Summary

A meta multi-tower research program for the ResonantOS / ResonantDAO economy.
Four **isolated** tower dispatches (failed-DAO/crypto, formal-mechanisms,
science-of-science, socioeconomic-behavior) each ran whitepaper-only, depth-1
search-bounded (≤6 sources/sub-lane — no recursive paper-chasing), with an
in-corpus skeptic, producing reconciled tower findings. A terminal cross-corpus
**program synthesis** reconciled the four by attack-lane, survived a
Popper/Quine/Meadows robot-talks round (collapse detection preserved), and the
auditor accepted it. All five dispatches closed `resolved`.

The program's two load-bearing design ideas: **two-axis tension** (within a tower
the corpus is fixed → tension on *methodology*; across towers each is a corpus →
tension on *source-corpus*, realized at synthesis), and **degree decided inside
each tower** (sub-lane count scoped from each corpus's own breadth). The same
pattern is staged for reuse as the `tower-research-program` spell (handoff in the
`domainspec-core/arcanum` repo).

## The Start Path (what to do next)

The synthesis emitted a ranked **fixture & constitution backlog**
([findings.md §3](../../../dispatch/economy-synthesis/findings.md)). It is three
ownable tracks, cheapest-unblocker first:

- **Track B — authority / whitepaper (do first, highest leverage):** snapshot the
  whitepaper and land six un-ledgered facts (1B supply, buyback-burn,
  `$R10/$R12/$R15`, six-sector `$RCT`, custodian-bootstrap, AI-agent-sponsor) in
  [claims/SOURCE-CLAIM-LEDGER.md](../../../claims/SOURCE-CLAIM-LEDGER.md); this
  un-gates a cluster of analogy→finding mappings and is the precondition for the
  Douceur costly-identity **GATE** (anti-sybil; whitepaper-blocking). Route the
  maintenance-as-first-class requirement and the §0.3 prohibition posture to
  [authority/promotion-policy.md](../../../authority/promotion-policy.md).
- **Track A — fixtures (owner `research-evidence-harness`):** four decidable-now
  fixtures, build order flow-conservation → runway-inequality → TF-11
  measurement≠authority (publish adversary class first) → TF-3 three-arm
  legitimacy. Pattern them on the existing
  [contribution-edge-fixtures](contribution-edge-fixtures.md) package (schema,
  matrix, typed-negatives, checklist) — that scaffold is the *template*, not the
  same fixture.
- **Track C — constitution (owner `constitution-governance`):** the bounty/fairness
  constitution (R7); sybil-bounty stays BLOCKED until its own gaming witness exists.

## Gate / Ledger State

- Tower dispatches: `2026-06-27-econ-tower-{failed-dao-crypto,formal-mechanisms,science-of-science,socioeconomic-behavior}` — registered + closed `resolved`.
- Program synthesis: `2026-06-27-econ-program-synthesis` — registered + closed `resolved`, auditor ACCEPT.
- Parent (lineage only, not a ledger row): `2026-06-27-resonantos-economy-program` (`meta: true`).
- 19 tower agents + 6 synthesis agents; each zig-zag ran once.

## Reusable Selectors

- `economy-resilience-program` for the full towers→synthesis structure.
- `economy-fixture-constitution-backlog` for the ranked start path (Tracks A/B/C).
- `four-decidable-now-fixtures` (flow-conservation, runway-inequality, TF-11, TF-3 three-arm).
- `douceur-identity-cost-gate` for the upstream anti-sybil precondition.
- `tower-research-program-pattern` for the reusable spell handoff.
- `two-axis-tension` (methodology within a tower, source-corpus across towers).

## Residue

Nothing is validated — the four fixtures are validation-*ready*, not validated.
Un-snapshotted-whitepaper assertions stay operator-reading until ledgered. No
source tested crowding-out inside a tokenized DAO (external-validity flag). The
Douceur gate awaits a costly-identity primitive the whitepaper does not yet supply.

## Promotion Boundary

This entry is a non-authority read model of a research result. It promotes
nothing into definitions, constitutions, specs, token policy, bounty policy,
governance authority, anti-gaming proof, launch readiness, or implementation.
